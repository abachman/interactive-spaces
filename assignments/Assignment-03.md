# Assignment 3 - 22-Apr-2019

Produce your own documentation for our finished project. The format is a short presentation or document that includes the following:

* Photos of the finished piece and brief (30s to 1m) video of interaction.
* Short written or visual description of the project. This should include:
    * To the best of your ability, a diagram of **at least one** finished object from the project. This is descriptive and doesn't need to be technically precise. Think sketch, not schematic. Make sure to capture sensor, controller (computer or microcontroller), and visible user interface.
    * A description of the resulting data flow in the system.
    * A statement describing data privacy / ethics considerations.
    * Links to any code (GitHub repository or properly formatted text document), social media posts, images, videos, or any other notable material you produced in the course of the semester.
* A breakdown of your contributions to the project as you understand them.
* Acknowledgements to any team members that were particularly helpful or supportive to you.

Additionally, you may wish to include:

* Description of your process.
* Discussion of idea vs execution / intention vs. outcome.
* Basic "time card" breaking out time spent on: Planning, Implementing, Polishing, and Documenting
* List of stumbling blocks or lingering questions.
* Ideas for continuing the project. Where next? How might you do it differently?

This is a big project! There were a lot of moving parts and I'd like to hear your reflections on it. The goal here is to find a way to describe the project in your own voice that will be suitable for including in your personal portfolio.

**This assignment will be due in class on April 29**, you will not be required to present it to the class.
