## Description

From the online course listing:

> Students learn and apply various media, methods, concepts and technologies to create interactive and/or responsive installations, and investigate the way people relate to objects, people and spaces through the creation of dynamic, site-conditioned projects. Sound, electronics, participation, games, play and beyond are used for the creation of participatory, installation events. Students work both individually and collaboratively throughout the semester.

We have the unique opportunity this semester (Spring 2019) to participate in the design and creation of a large scale, network connected, sensor driven installation art project spanning the MICA campus. Our goal is to produce a stream of live data and, along with multiple collaborators, generate a series of unique, expressive images for use in future MICA communications.

This class will involve us walking together through the difficult and interesting work of taking a project from concept to reality. We will experience, almost certainly, new types of failure and the joy of creation. Not every idea we have will be good on the first try, so we will iterate, we will refine, we may step back and evaluate, but we will finish.

Not every step on the path we will take together has been laid out for us. Sometimes I, as instructor, will show you the way forward, sometimes we will discover it together, sometimes you will be required to find it on your own.

 
## Goals, Standards, Expectations

During this course:

* Students will propose new sources of data for live and interactive art through written and oral reports.
* Students will prototype and implement new hardware-based methods for gathering data.
* Students will work with a team to complete creative and technical projects to given specifications.
* Students will practice the skills of breaking down the steps required to complete complex work and estimating the time required for each step. 
* Students will document an interactive art project.


## Supplies / Must Haves

Services and accounts:

* [GitHub account](https://github.com)

Applications:

* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (Mac or Windows app)
* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX)

* Google Chrome (Browser)

As we come across an interesting new service or app, we may add it to the list.

Materials:

* Basic sketching / paper prototyping supplies
* Budget $50 to $100 for project supplies.


## Grading

Your grade will be based on the following breakdown:

* 40% Participation
* 40% Exercises and Presentations
* 20% Documentation

More than three unexcused absences will generally result in a failing grade for the course.


## Class participation

> As a citizen of the classroom, you are expected to actively participate in class exercises, discussions, and critiques. In addition, this class is intended to function as a peer learning environment. I encourage you to support and talk to one another during class, particularly if you are experiencing any difficulty.

(via [Sam Sheffield](http://samsheffield.com/pandas14/docs/syllabus.pdf))

The majority of your grade in this class will be based on participation. The most important part of participating fully is your physical presence. You must be in attendance at every class session to receive full credit for the course.

The second part of participation is your attention to the work at hand. Distractions (including cellphones, laptops, projects from other classes, etc.) should be silent and out of sight during class.


## Location Research and Site Visits

Due to the distributed nature of the final project, it is likely that we will be traveling as a class to other sites on campus for research, installation, and project review. Groups or individuals installing work elsewhere on campus may also be required to travel outside of class time.


## Documentation

What should documentation include?

- Photos of the finished piece and brief (30s to 1m) video of interaction.
- Written description of the project. Less than a page.
- The final, running version of all source code.
- A rough circuit diagram. Descriptive, doesn't need to be technically precise. Sketch, not schematic.
- A description of the data flow in your project.
- A data privacy / ethics statement, if applicable.
- Acknowledgements and references. All references must include links. This includes:
    - inspiration
    - any projects you borrowed code from w/ the license under which it was shared
    - citations for all images or words that are not your own
- A breakdown of each team members' contributions.

Additionally, you may wish to include:

- Description of your process.
- Discussion of idea vs execution / intention vs. outcome.
- Basic "time card" breaking out time spent on:
    - Planning
    - Implementing
    - Polishing
    - Documenting
- List of stumbling blocks or lingering questions.
- Ideas for continuing the project. Where next? How might you do it differently?

Documentation may be the only evidence that you completed the project that lasts beyond this class. It is how I will be able to evaluate and remember your work as the instructor. It is how you reflect on what you've done and how you grow as an artist / human being making things. It will be useful to your career beyond this class. 

Good Art + Good Documentation = ❤️

# MICA Notices

### Attendance

You are expected to be at every class unless you have a valid excuse.

Arriving more than 15 minutes after class starts is counted as an unexcused absence. Two unexcused absences will result in a reduced grade. More than three unexcused absences (missing more than 25% of the course) generally results in a failing grade.

### Academic Disability Accommodations

MICA makes reasonable academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. All academic accommodations must be approved through the Learning Resource Center (LRC). Students requesting accommodation should schedule an appointment at the LRC (410-225-2416 or e-mail LRC@mica.edu), located in Bunting 110. It is the student’s responsibility to make an accommodation request in a timely manner. Academic accommodations are not retroactive.

### Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)

Students are responsible to follow health and safety guidelines relevant to their individual activities, processes, and to review MICA's Emergency Operations Plan and attend EHS training. Students are required to purchase personal protection equipment appropriate for their major or class. Those students who do not have the proper personal protection equipment will not be permitted to attend class until safe measures and personal protection are in place.

### Plagiarism

Each discipline within the arts has specific and appropriate means for students to cite or acknowledge sources and the ideas and material of others used in their own work. Students have the responsibility to become familiar with such processes and to carefully follow their use in developing original work.

#### *Policy*

MICA will not tolerate plagiarism, which is **defined as claiming authorship of, or using someone else's ideas or work without proper acknowledgement**. Without proper attribution, a student may NOT replicate another's work, paraphrase another's ideas, or appropriate images in a manner that violates the specific rules against plagiarism in the student's department. **In addition, students may not submit the same work for credit in more than one course without the explicit approval of all of the instructors of the courses involved.**

#### *Consequences*

When an instructor has evidence that a student has plagiarized work submitted for course credit, the instructor will confront the student and impose penalties that may include failing the course. In the case of a serious violation or repeated infractions from the same student, the instructor will report the infractions to the department chair or program director. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the department chair or program director may then report the student to the appropriate dean or provost, who may choose to impose further penalties, including expulsion.

#### *Appeal Process*

Students who are penalized by an instructor or department for committing plagiarism have the right to appeal the charge and penalties that ensue. Within three weeks of institutional action, the student must submit a letter of appeal to the department chairperson or program director, or relevant dean or provost related to the course for which actions were taken. The academic officer will assign three members of the relevant department/division to serve on a review panel. The panel will meet with the student and the instructor of record and will review all relevant and available materials. The panel will determine whether or not to confirm the charge and penalties. The findings of the panel are final. The panel will notify the instructor, the chairperson, division, the student, and the Office of Academic Affairs of their findings and any recommendations for change in penalties.

### Title IX Notification

Maryland Institute College of Art seeks to provide an educational environment based on mutual respect that is free from discrimination and harassment. If you have encountered sexual harassment/misconduct/assault, please know that there are multiple ways to report it and you are encouraged to do so (www.mica.edu/equal_opportunity). If you require academic adjustments due to an incident involving sexual harassment or discrimination, please contact Student Affairs at 410.225.2422 or Human Resources at 410.225.2363. Please be aware that in order to meet our commitments to equity and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, faculty and staff members are required to report disclosures of gender based discrimination made to them by students. However, nothing in this policy shall abridge academic freedom or MICA’s educational mission. Prohibitions against discrimination and discriminatory harassment do not extend to actions, statements or written materials that are relevant and appropriately related to course subject matter or academic discussion.

### Students with Extended Illness or Cause for Legitimate Absence

In the case of extended illness or other absences that may keep the student from attending a class for more than three meetings, undergraduate students must contact the Student Development Specialist in the Division of Student Affairs or have an official disability accommodation letter issued by the Learning Resource Center that specifically addresses class absences. For students who have not been approved for academic disability accommodations, the Student Development Specialist will work with the student to determine the cause and appropriateness of the absences and subsequently notify instructors as necessary. Graduate students must contact the instructor, program director, and the Office of Graduate Studies. Students in professional studies programs must contact the Associate Dean for Open Studies. The appropriate administrator will facilitate a conversation with relevant faculty to determine whether the student can achieve satisfactory academic progress, which is ultimately at the sole discretion of the faculty member.
